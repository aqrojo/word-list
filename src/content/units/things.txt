Smart phone? That's essential. I love it. I use it all the time, for everything.
I talk to people, chat, text, take photos. I couldn't live without my phone.
Microwave? That's essential. I don't have lots of time for cooking, so I use it a lot.
Television? Not essential. I don't watch much television. DVD
I use my phone. So, what else?
Laptop? That's really essential, I use my laptop for work, so yes, I need that.
Tablet? Hmm. I guess it's not essential.

Which are essential? All of them!
Goodness. Right. Smart phone? Essential. I don't go anywhere without my phone.
I need it in case there's an emergency and I have to call someone.
Or if there's a problem with one of the children.
Yes, I definitely need my phone.
TV? That's essential really. I couldn't live without my television and DVD player.
Umm. Laptop? Well, I need a computer really so yes, that's essential.
Tablet. Well, no that's not essential.
Digital camera? I suppose I don't need that.
Someone else can take the photos!
What else? Microwave. No. I can live without that.
